This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to get javascript code metrics through [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
docker run -it -v $PWD/src/test/resources:/src codacy/codacy-metrics-eslint:latest
```

## Test

Before running the tests, you need to install ESLint. The tool [README](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/README.md) provides you instructions on how to do so.

After that, you can run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```
